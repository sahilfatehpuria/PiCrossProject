# PiCrossProject
To run this project, run make build and then make play in the terminal
Picross puzzles, also known as nonograms, is a personal favourite of mine. It involves using clues to fill some squares in a grid to reveal a picture.
This project, created for my functional programming class using OCaml, is able to automatically solve any Picross puzzles using one layer deep logic.
That is to say, the core functionality is that for each row it tests every valid assignment of filled squares and sees if there are any squares that are always filled or empty. If so, it enters these as fixed. It the repeats the process for each column, and does this again till the puzzle is solved. The fixed squares restrict the options over each iteration until the solution is found. This process works for the vast majority of solvable puzzles.
This solver is a part of a simple command line interface that allows users to play picross puzzles (stored as json files. 1 is a filled square, -1 is marked empty, 0 is unmarked). The solutions allow users to check their answers. A hint mechanism is also included. This is independent of the solution, and can run fast to get one valid square. 
To see solved versions, rerun the program and enter the name of the sol version of the puzzle generated by the code.

## Work to do
The project needs a GUI for users to be able to play the game conveniently.
